# 🧐 Want to help? Here's how

Documents are written using GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## How to update the docs

1. Go to the repository root.
2. Select a document you’d like to work on.

   _Something feels wrong? Unsure about the changes? [Open an issue to discuss them!](https://github.com/MartinM10/dev-reference-guide/issues/new)_

   _If you are looking where to contribute, we have a list of documents we'd love to see written! [Check out our projects](https://github.com/MartinM10/dev-reference-guide/projects)._

3. Search for the [![Open for contributions](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-blue.svg?logo=github)](CONTRIBUTING.md) badge.

   _No badge? Maybe the document is not open for contributions (e.g., the official calendar). [Open an issue instead](https://github.com/MartinM10/dev-reference-guide/issues/new)_.

4. In the top-right, select **Edit this file** and make changes.
5. For the commit message, please follow our [Conventional Commits guide](docs/CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS.md). Use 3-5 words, start with `docs:`, and do not end with a period.

   _Do:_

   > docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
   >
   > docs: improve VMs setup section

   _Do not:_

   > minor changes
   >
   > WIP

6. Select **Commit changes** 🎉

For more complex contributions, you can open an issue to describe the changes you'd like to see.
